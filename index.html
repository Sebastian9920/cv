    When I was a young lad, I wouldnt call myself a young lad. I would call myself a bad
    apple. I was the kind of kid that would throw his stroller at people and laugh (I thought ofmyslf as a tyrant, giving boo-boos to all the unuspecting).
    The only thing I enjoyed more was hanging and jokeing with my bro. I've half assed relationships
    all my life and now am ready to full ass them. Yes you heard me right, I've taken up squats! I feel changing
    this now is a huge task, and I dont have time for it while I try to make a life for myself, so I will make time (for the booty!). On a good note I've had
    some good experiences In my life and plan to have more. I like being evil but not hurting people. I have yet to find a way to make these traits coexist...
    At the same time, I don't like talking behind peoples backs but love talking shit to someones face. The inner white girl in me loves to travell, take photos
    while travelling, although I have no where to post them (I gueess instagram but can't post entire albums on there).
